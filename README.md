# fluentfox
A combination of fluentdotfox and some css code I got from https://superuser.com/questions/1653533/how-to-switch-back-to-firefox-old-style-of-tabs. The goal is to make an exact replica of microsoft edge legacy in firefox. 
This includes fancy effects as well. 
I'm not a developer, i only report issues. 
I wanted a fluent style firefox for everyone to use. 
So, I created this repository. 

I will check this often. 

anyone will be able to make changes to this repository. 

I would like an installation script for linux as well.

Something like ./install.sh. 

If you want to try it out, do this. 

go to about:config in firefox.

type or copy and paste toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and change it to true. 

If it is already true leave it alone! 

now go to about:support in firefox. 

click on open directory. 

create a new file called chrome.

now download the userChrome.css file and paste it into the chrome folder. 

Enjoy!
