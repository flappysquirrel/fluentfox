## About


A combination of FluentDotFox and some css code I got from [this superuser post](https://superuser.com/questions/1653533/how-to-switch-back-to-firefox-old-style-of-tabs) And in 2021 I also combined firefox-91plus-photon-userchrome-master! The goal is to make an exact replica of Microsoft Edgeâ„¢ Legacy in Mozilla Firefox.
This includes fancy effects as well!
I'm not a developer, I only report issues... But I wanted a Fluent style Firefox for everyone to use. So, I created this repository.
