## About
A combination of FluentDotFirefox, Firefox-91plus-photon-userchrome-master and Firefox UWP style! The goal is to make an exact replica of Microsoft Edgeâ„¢ Legacy in Mozilla Firefox.
I'm not a developer, I usually report issues...  But I wanted a Fluent style Firefox for everyone to use. So, I created this repository. 

## News 

New Combination! (Firefox UWP style project) Details below. 
 
New repository launched! https://github.com/YuvanMichael/FluentWin11

Microsoft edge (chromium) is getting fluent design. Soon edge (chromium) will look like edge (legacy)(with rounded corners)(Now on Windows 11)

This repository Works on Windows 11 as well!


## Install

### ![Picture 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86945563/138727515-0171f4ad-de9d-4697-b1c0-76169382dbd7.png)


## How to install

  1. Go to about config in firefox. and paste toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and set it to true. 
  2. In firefox go the menu
  3. Help
  4. More Troubleshooting Information
  5. Open directory or open folder for your profile
  6. Download this repository by Clicking on code and Download zip
  7. Extract the file
  8. Copy and Paste the chrome folder in your firefox profile (The open directory thing)
  9. Restart firefox
  10. Enjoy!

Note: If you don't like the tab size you can change it by going to about:config again and paste browser.tabs.tabMinWidth and change it to the number you want. This is because the density setting in customize toolbar feature of Firefox does not change the tab size. This little tweak is easy to do and requires only a couple of clicks. 

Enjoy!

## For better experience
  go to about:config in firefox and type general.smoothScroll.msdPhysics.enabled and set it to true.
