### ![Picture 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86945563/138727515-0171f4ad-de9d-4697-b1c0-76169382dbd7.png)


How to install

If you want to try it out, do this.

Click code button and then click download zip to download this project so you can use this on Firefox

Extract the folder

go to about:config in firefox.

type or copy and paste toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and change it to true.

If it is already true leave it alone!

now go to about:support in firefox.

click on open directory.

Paste the chrome folder

Restart Firefox

Note: If you don't like the tab size you can change it by going to about:config again and paste browser.tabs.tabMinWidth and change it to the number you want. This is because the density setting in customize toolbar feature of Firefox does not change the tab size. This little tweak is easy to do and requires only a couple of clicks. 

Enjoy!

## For better experience
  go to about:config in firefox and type general.smoothScroll.msdPhysics.enabled and set it to true.

## About
A combination of FluentDotFirefox, Firefox-91plus-photon-userchrome-master and Firefox UWP style! The goal is to make an exact replica of Microsoft Edgeâ„¢ Legacy in Mozilla Firefox.
I'm not a developer, I usually report issues...  But I wanted a Fluent style Firefox for everyone to use. So, I created this repository.
