## About


A combination of FluentDotFox and some css code I got from [this superuser post](https://superuser.com/questions/1653533/how-to-switch-back-to-firefox-old-style-of-tabs). The goal is to make an exact replica of Microsoft Edgeâ„¢ Legacy in Mozilla Firefox. 
This includes fancy effects as well!
I'm not a developer, i only report issues... But I wanted a Fluent style Firefox for everyone to use. So, I created this repository. 

##Contributing

I will check this often. 

Anyone will be able to make changes to this repository! 

I would like an installation script for linux as well.

Something like ./install.sh.
